# ML_Project_Template
This template is a general architecture for any Machine Learning project
The `requirements.txt` file contains typical and most common libraries used 
for machine learning projects in Python

If any other library are required please adjust in `requirements.txt` file

Make sure that last line in the `requirements.txt` file is always `-e .` 
It will automatically create a package

```sh 
pip install -r requirements.txt
